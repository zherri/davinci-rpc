<h2>How the rich presence works</h2>
The rich presence is <strong>provided by an executable that runs together with the DaVinci Resolve executable</strong>. This is possible through a <code>.bat</code> file shortcut that <strong>masquerades as
DaVinci Resolve</strong> (for visual reasons, only). So, for the rich presence to work, <strong>you have to open your DaVinci through the desktop shortcut or the app folder shortcut</strong>, which are created during installation.
<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<strong>1.</strong> Go to the latest <a href="https://github.com/zherri/davinci-rpc/releases/latest">Release</a> and download the <code>DaVinciRPCInstaller.rar</code>;<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Unzip the downloaded file;<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Execute the <code>.exe</code> file and proceed with the installation;<br>
<strong>4.</strong> After installation is completed, you are good to go!
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
Once the installation is done, you can just double-click the <strong>desktop icon</strong>, if you selected the option to <code>Create a desktop shortcut</code> during the installation, or
you can go to the <strong>folder where you chose install the RPC</strong> (the default was in <code>C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\DaVinciRPC</code>),
there you can right-click the <strong>another shortcut</strong> created and pin it on your taskbar or start menu.
